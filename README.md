# Allergies
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

## Tests

Run `grunt watch` then edit your files. Grunt will watch for changes. Grunt
will only run tests that start with `it`. When you finish passing a test,
remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

## Background

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).

The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

* eggs (1)
* peanuts (2)
* shellfish (4)
* strawberries (8)
* tomatoes (16)
* chocolate (32)
* pollen (64)
* cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:

- Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.
- All the allergens Tom is allergic to.
